# Welcome to My Portfolio!
### About Me
I am a senior studying Computer Engineering. This past summer, I was at the
University of Florida working on IPOP, an open source user-centric virtual network, where I created a scalable testing environment to visualize the correctness of the VPN software using Bash Scripting, Python and Linux Containers (LXC). Last Spring, I worked at Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLBDM) as a Web Development Co-op creating web applications using technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Cucumber and Hibernate. I am also very familiar with PHP and front-end web technologies like Angular and Backbone Marionette having worked at the Office of Student Financial Aid at Iowa State for a full year before interning at FHLBDM.
